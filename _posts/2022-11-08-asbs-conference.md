## People, plants, and presentations

This week the Australian Systematic Botany conference for early career researchers was held at the Australian Botanic Gardens, Mount Annan. Lots of very interesting talks from students and post docs on Australian flora; topics ranged from plant macrofossil identification (Rachel Atkins), to pollinator/angiosperm diversification (Ruby Stevens, Julian Herting, and Yasmin Asar), to the importance of photographic vouchers in botany (Thomas Mesaglio). Great job also to my colleages Richard Diamon and Patrick Fahey who presented some of their work from [ReCER](https://recer.org.au/). 

It was also a great opportunity to explore the new national herbarium and plant nursery. I was able to visit some of the endangered *Persoonia*, *Pimelea*, and *Zieria* species I've been working on recently for the Saving our Species conservation initiative. They're growing up strong!

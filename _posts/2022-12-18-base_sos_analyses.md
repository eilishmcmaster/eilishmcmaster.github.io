I'm a conservation geneticist at the Research Centre for Ecosystem Resilience [(ReCER)](https://recer.org.au/) in Sydney, and I work on the Saving our Species (SoS) projects of the Department of Planning and Environment. SoS officers who manage vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered plant species in the state come to us for advice on how to best manage their species based on population genomic analyses. This week I uploaded outlines of my base analyses I use for this process to [github](https://github.com/eilishmcmaster/BaseSoSAnalyses) so anyone interested in the pipeline can look under the hood. In 2021 ReCER published a paper on this pipeline, which can be found [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rec.12898).

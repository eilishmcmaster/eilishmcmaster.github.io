## First sampling trip 
This week I went sampling Acacia terminalis ssp. terminalis (a.k.a. the sunshine wattle) seeds with Sam. This is an endangered subspecies found only in the Sydney region. We plan to use the seeds for fitness experiments and to investigate the mating system of this species. If you'd like to see this species, there's a large population at North Head in Manly which is also where we ran into the echidna!
